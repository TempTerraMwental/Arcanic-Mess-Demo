# Armess
  Armess is a game written in C++, JS, and HTML. Right now, all we are working on is getting a working demo up and running smoothly with all the key mechanics in. However, the HTML and JS portion of the components will not be in the full game. They are only meant for running the demo in a browser window if necessary. There is a chance that we will bring full game to the browser using the HTML and JS scripts, though.
## This demo is for recreational use only.
  Only TempTerraMental and/or its authorized personnel may use the demo as anything more than a demo. Others may use it as a credited reference or example, but not a  product and/or service.
## Purpose
The purpose is to create a small, working demonstration of the mechanics we want in the full game. Not all of the mechanics will be put in the game. There will also not be a plot or story in the demo.
